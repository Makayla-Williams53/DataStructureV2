# DataStructure

## Project for Advanced Java

This was a project for my high school Advanced Java class in Februrary of 2023. In this project
we were assigned to research a data structure and implement it in InteliJ. We had to learn and 
implement all the various methods that are entailed in the data structure, adding elemtns, deleting
elements, traversing, and output. I chose to do this in the form of learning and implementing Perfect
Binary Trees, this is a binary tree where each branch ends at the same height, making it perfectly even.

Requirements:
1) Add element method
2) Remove element method
3) Traverse elements method
4) Output data in structure
5) Nodes hold data
6) Nodes have getters and setters
7) Nodes output data
8) Have a visualization of the data structure
